            <h2>Our Journey</h2>
            <p>
                We began this project with contstructing a secure login and banking connection. After this was set, we implemented the personalization of the user's digital signature and confirming identity. To further enhance the application, we created a full payment workflow with real-time updates and a verified digital receipt.

            <h2>Why Desktop?</h2>
            <p>
                Based on user research, participants reported feeling the most confident when completing financial tasls on a desktop interface due to larger screens which enables more precise input control. For future expansion, we are planning on creating a mobile app for the Trust Signature.
